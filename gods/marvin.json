He's also incredibly smart, having a brain the size of a planet capable of computing extremely complex mathematics. Marvin has to perform menial tasks and labour such as escorting people, opening doors, picking up pieces of paper, and other tasks well beneath his skills.  This leaves him extremely bored, frustrated, and overwhelmingly depressed.",
